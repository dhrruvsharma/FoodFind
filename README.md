# Food Product List Application Solution

## Overview
This project is a web application that displays food products fetched from the [OpenFoodFacts API](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/). The solution includes several features to enhance the user experience, such as searching, filtering, sorting, and viewing product details. It also ensures a responsive design that works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Technical Details

- **API Integration:** The OpenFoodFacts API is integrated using `axios` to fetch product data.
- **State Management:** The applicationâ€™s state is managed using the `useContext` hook to handle global states such as the list of products, search results, and filters.
- **Styling:** The UI is designed using **CSS** with a focus on simplicity and responsiveness. No CSS frameworks like Bootstrap are used.
- **Routing:** **React Router DOM** is used to handle navigation between the product list and product detail pages.
- **Sorting:** Sorting of the product list is handled by making requests to the OpenFoodFacts API with the required parameters.
